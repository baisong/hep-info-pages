                A humane eater is concerned about how animals are treated in our factory farm food system.  As a humane eater, you are making a choice to stop creating demand for cruel food.<br><br>
                We aren’t trying to police restaurants or apply strict definitions of humane at this time. Our goal is more modest: to simply map out where humane options are and promote restaurants that are trying to do the right thing. <br><br>

                In future versions of the app, we plan to highlight restaurants that are sourcing from humane certified farms accredited by Global Animal Partnership (GAP), Animal Welfare Approved (AWA), or Certified Humane. These organizations have the highest standards for animal welfare and perform audit to verify that their standards are met.  It is important to note that even the highest standards do not cover all animal welfare issues. While they are a tremendous improvement, they do not mean the animal lived an entirely free of cruelty. The most humane option is always vegan.

                Some of these terms indicate small improvements in the treatment of farm animals, but none amount to a cruelty free life. Many of these terms address only one issue of animal welfare. For example, cage-free chickens will not be in cages, but may still face overcrowding and beak trimming in large, warehouse like factories. There is no third party auditing to verify most of these terms.

                Mulesing is when sections of skin around the tail of sheep are removed. It is performed on sheep that produce wool to prevent lesions and infections from flies. This is usually done without anesthetic. The use of temporary pain control is becoming more common, but is not enough. The procedure is not necessary, as alternatives exist.

                Mulesing is mostly performed in Australia; however, many US retailers import Australian wool. Some progress is being made. A number of companies have urged Australia to end mulesing in favor of alternatives.

                The humane aspects regarding seafood are complex and varied. Some seafood options, such as scallops, are humane. Other options, like lobster, are cruel. Some seafood choices support fishing practices that result in bycatch. For example, for every one pound of harvested shrimp, four pounds of other seafood are caught (e.g. fish, turtles). 
                <br><br>
                Currently there are no animal welfare certifications that certifies wild or farmed seafood production. In the future, we plan to address seafood when we can do so in a way that provides high value to our users.

                Calves used for veal come from the dairy industry (link to dairy section). Calves are taken from their mothers within a day of being born. The females are raised as dairy cows while the males are used for veal. Half of all veal comes from calves kept in veal crates – small, dark crates that keep the calves immobile. Veal crates limit muscle development to produce meat that is more tender.

                Foie gras is the fattened liver of a duck or goose. The liver is fattened through a process of force feeding. Force feeding causes the liver to grow to 6-10 times its normal size. To force feed a bird, a worker inserts a metal feeding tube that forces the bird to eat several times more than it would voluntarily. The feeding tubes harm the bird’s throat and can severely injure or kill him. Force fed birds suffer impaired liver functions because of the liver’s swollen size. It can grow so big that it expands to other parts of the abdomen, making it difficult to breathe.

                Shark fin soup is a Chinese dish served on special occasions. Culturally, it is a luxury item and a symbol of wealth. Fishermen obtain the fins by catching a shark, removing its fin, and throwing it back into the ocean – all while the shark is still alive. Without its fin, the shark is unable to swim properly. It sinks to the bottom of the ocean or is eaten by other predators. Shark fin soup has been banned in some countries and in a handful of U.S. states. Demand for the dish has decreased significantly in recent years thanks to awareness campaigns. How to spot on the menu: Served in Chinese restaurants as “shark fin soup.”

                <br><br>
                Tone<br>
                </b>Its very important that the tone be kept positive and business like. Its important that humane eating is a trend and the tide is moving in this direction.   They will be missing out on business by not responding to this growing demand. In addition, humane eater's are very loyal customers and are willing to pay a premium to ensure that animals are treated better.

                Getting a restaurant to "Go humane"<br>
                </b>We suggest dining at the restaurant first.  If you are a vegan/vegetarian and want to encourage them to add a vegan/vegetarian then simply let them know this and that when they do that you will add them to the Humane Eating Project.  Remind them that they are missing out on vegan/vegetarian customers and that one or two veg items doesn't cut it - they need a menu (at least 25% in size as the main menu) to be included in the app.   <br><br>If you are a meat eater and want to encourage them to add humanely-raised options,  let them know that they can be included with as little as one dish clearly identified as Humanely Raised.  Let them know that people are really starting to pay attention to this issue and they are losing customers - but not at least having one option on the menu for people to chose.

                Getting a restaurant to get off the Watch List<br>

Let the restaurant know that they are on the Watch List on the app and which menu items are causing them that designation - and that many people are very disturbed by that type of food and will use tools like the Humane Eating Project to avoid their restaurant.  The app should speak for itself from there.<br><br>

                We are including every restaurant that has a vegan/vegetarian menu or that mentions humanely-raised food in its menu or website. Similar terms such as “humane” or “humanely-treated” are allowed. Initially we need to map out everywhere the term is being used and encourage restaurants to do the right thing. In a future release, once we have achieved a critical mass of users and restaurants, we will indicate which restaurants are sourcing from third party humane-certified farms using third party certification organizations such as Certified Humane, Animal Welfare Approved, and Global Animal Partnership.

                Terms like free-range or grass-fed indicate some marginal benefit to farm animals, but do not equate to a commitment of treating an animal humanely. Many of these terms address only one issue of animal welfare. Vegan is the only option that is completely cruelty-free, but eating humanely-raised is a big improvement over eating factory farmed meat.

                While donations are always appreciated, we need to raise awareness about how easy it is to eat humanely. Please spread the word to your friends, family, and coworkers and like or share our posts on Facebook and Twitter. We also need help from our users to add new listings, particularly humane restaurants.

                The health benefits are very high for eating vegan and significant for eating vegetarian. Undoubtedly, most farmers that raise their animals humanely are also feeding them a better diet, not giving them an excess of of antibiotics, and so on. Humane farms are likely better for the environment in many ways – but the point of the Humane Eating Project is really to focus on eating in ways that cause less cruelty to animals. The rest of the benefits are a bonus!

                We plan to add grocery stores in the future. We feel that restaurants are more important right now for a variety of reasons. If you want to buy humanely-raised products at your grocery store, there are three third party certifications to look for: Global Animal Partnership (GAP), Certified Humane, and Animal Welfare Approved (AWA). GAP-certified products are available at Whole Foods. You can search the Certified Humane and AWA websites for where to find their products near you.

                The humane aspects regarding seafood are complex and varied and there are no animal welfare certifications to verify wild or farmed practices. We plan to address seafood when we can do so in a way that provides high value to our users.

                Short answer: At launch time we will have Vegan/Vegetarian restaurant listings globally but for Humane-Friendly and Watch-List restaurants we only have data for the USA. With the help of VegGuide.org, we have over 20,000 restaurants total in our database.
                <br><br>
                Long answer: We encourage users all around the world to use the app and add more Humane Friendly and Watch List restaurants to make the app more global oriented.
                <br><br>
                In the future, we will have to customize the Watch List feature country-by-country because these issues are unique to each country. We will also have to customize the educational aspects of the app (The Learn button) – again, to be more relevant to each country. In the more distant future, we’ll add support for other languages aside from English.
                <br><br>
                So as it is now, the app is geared towards users in the USA, but we hope that changes quickly.
